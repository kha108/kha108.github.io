       <h1>REVIEW OF INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE</h1>

        <h2 style="color: #2e2e2e;"> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h2> <br>
        <p>The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience is the “removed” image of the janitor, which shows their mundane existence society today. 
        Besides that, there are dialogues of people showing disrespect towards janitors and taking advantage of their work. 
        I also paid attention to the aesthetics and color scheme of the webpage, which mainly uses black, white, blue and green.
        </p>

     <div class="div2">
        <h2 style="color: #2e2e2e;">Spend two minutes on the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2> <br>
       <ul>
        <li>Reading the title which explains the primary goal of the interactive experience.</li>
        <li>the top of the page which leads you to different sections of the webpage.</li>
        <li>As I scroll down the page,</li>
       </ul>
     </div>

     <div class="div3">
        <img src="hearts.png" class="image3">
        <h2 style="color:#2e2e2e;">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2> <br>
        <p>I spent most of most time engaging with the part where you click the heart to send kindness to all people in the working professions. 
            If you click the heart, multiple smaller hearts will appear and float on the page. 
            The more you click, the more hearts will appear and eventually fill the page
        </p>
     </div>

     <div class="div4">
        <h2 style="color: #2e2e2e;"> What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?  </h2> <br>
        <p>TThe most common action in my two minutes interaction with the experience is scrolling. Since the experience is designed as a single scrolling webpage, some transitions are presented with a series of actions as you scroll though. 
        </p>
     </div>

     <div class="div5">
        <h2 style="color: #2e2e2e;"> What is the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h2> <br>
        <p>The goal of the interactive experience is to educate the audience about the importance of the janitorial profession in society through a creative and immersive method. It is also to show the significance of professions, ensuring that those in “working” professions are not treated with prejudice, but rather are able to appreciate the labor of others.
